Social Media Anxiety

## Project Overview

Using data, how can we begin to solve the rising depression issue within the younger generations when it relates to social media and is there any data trends or systems that could potentially help us get there?

## Self Assessment and Reflection

<!-- Edit the following section with your self assessment and reflection -->

I feel like I was able to answer part of the question, kind of lead to a different question mid project, but I felt like I was able to answer a great question with my research, my execution definitely could have been better, but I feel like I learned alot from this class and this project.

Thanks for all the great assignments!

### Self Assessment
<!-- Replace the (...) with your score -->

| Category          | Score    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| **Setup**         | 8 / 10 |
| **Execution**     | 10 / 20 |
| **Documentation** | 7 / 10 |
| **Presentation**  | 30 / 30 |
| **Total**         | 55 / 70 |

### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

Through all of the EDA and charts, I feel like I actually came to a different conclusiont than the question I had originally posed, I wanted to know about how mental health correlates to social media usage, but I feel like I actually answered a different problem, being how money correlates to social media, which when you think about it, is alot of what current society calls mental health, generally people with higher social media usage have lower levels of productivity (higher levels of productivity loss) and therefore, do not have higher paying jobs, which we have found in studies previously, that while the famous line is money can't buy happiness, in a lot of cases, it can buy things that lead to happiness.

#### What went well?

Making visuals went really well, I also enjoyed the EDA process and coming up with conclusions from that.

#### What did not go well?

I feel like I did not do well with machine learning at all, hence why I took 10 points off of execution, I feel like everything about my execution was good except the ML bit.

#### What did you learn?

I learned that my weakness is machine learning and I need to do more looking into that.

#### What would you do differently next time?

Focus more on the machine learning aspect and also start this project sooner than I did, I feel like I handicapped myself by waiting until the final week of the semester to really dig into it.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
